Requires at least: 1.0
Tested up to: 4.9.5


I developed this plugin for your use. It's not very simple and takes a little knowledge of PHP code. I couldn't find a plugin that allowed for the same image to be rotated on a daily basis based on times.

== Description ==
I developed this plugin for your use. It's not very simple and takes a little knowledge of PHP code. I couldn't find a plugin that allowed for the same image to be rotated on a daily basis based on times. There is no direct user interface, all images and times have to be modifed in tdi-functions.php.

This is released under CDDL-1.0.

== Installation == Install plugin as you usually would, drag and drop in the /plugins/ directory. Modify tdi-functions.php with your image links based on when you want them to show.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Can I sell this? No.
Can I update this? Yes, just tell me and send me a changelog.If you help enough, I'll make you a contributor.
HF UID? 2654927 Where can I use this? Anywhere you want, but I'm not responsible for what you do with it.
Will you update this? I will update this if it needs to be updated. It's simple PHP and shouldn't need very much updating.

NOTICE 5/11/18:

This plugin is NOWHERE near done. I've still got a ton of work to complete so I can get this where I want it to be.
As it sits, this is a barebones plugin with a backend and little frontend functionality. It serves it's purpose but I'd like it
to be a hell of a lot prettier.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Portability Note: You can use this code on your site without wordpress, just use the include_once statement linked to main_api.php.
